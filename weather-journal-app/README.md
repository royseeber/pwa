# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This is the third project in the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nano Degree Program.
It involves creating an asynchronous web app that uses a Web API along with user supplied data to dynamically update the UI.

## Description
Starter code included an index.html and a style.css file. The server.js and app.js file were developed
from scratch. The style.css file required some customization to avoid overlapping elements and to make it look presentable on mobile screens; much like putting lipstick on a pig.

The app uses an api from openweathermap.org to retrieve current weather information based on a user supplied zip code.


## Dependencies
The project requires that Node.js be installed along with the following packages.
- Express
- Body-Parser
- Cors
