        <h1>Should You Give Bootstrap The Boot?</h1>
        <section class="post-intro">
            <p>
                If you're like me, you would have come across frameworks like Bootstrap while trying to figure out the nuances
                of responsive design. You probably sat down over a weekend and began playing around with container, row and column classes
                unable to <b>contain</b> your excitement as columns began automatically appearing and disappearing as you resized your screen.
                With the advent of HTML 5 and the CSS Grid component this has now become child's play.
            </p>
        </section>
        <br>
        <h2>CSS Grid Demo</h2>
        <p>
            With just a few lines of code you can set up a grid that is not only responsive but fluid. In other words it will
            dynamically resize itself as you resize your screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following sets up a 12 x 12 grid where the columns are sized
            as fractional units of equal size. A fractional unit represents the actual available space
            after subtracting out the space used up by fixed size elements, margins and padding.
        </p>
        <div class="code-box">
            <img class="code-image" src="../img/demo-grid.png" alt="css code">
        </div>
        <p>
            We can then reference any area of the grid with simple column and row number references like this.
        </p>
        <div class="code-box">
            <img class="code-image" src="../img/demo-box.png" alt="css code">
        </div>
        <p>
            The above is saying, draw a bounding box starting at column 4 extending across 6 columns,
            and starting at row 4 extending down 6 rows.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we will create the html code to draw a box centered inside the grid. If you were to resize the
            browser window, you would notice that the box inside the grid shrinks and grows while maintaining
            its position relative to the grid.
        </p>
        <div class="code-box">
            <img class="code-image" src="../img/demo-grid-html.png" alt="html code">
        </div>
        <div class="code-box">
            <img class="code-image" src="../img/demo-grid-out.png" alt="html code">
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>Responsive Text Demo</h2>
        <p>
            Another item that is getting a fair amout of press these days is fluid typography which is just a fancy way
            of saying "responsive text". I will now demonstrate just how trivial this amazing feat is.
        </p>
        <div class="code-box">
            <img class="code-image" src="../img/responsive-text-css.png" alt="css code">
        </div>
        <p>
            That's it. Its literally a 1 liner! The css code is setting the font-size to 3 percent of the
            viewport width which will cause the text size to dynamically change as the screen width expands and contracts.
            Lets take a look at some html to see the effect.
        </p>
        <div class="code-box">
            <img class="code-image" src="../img/responsive-text-html.png" alt="html code">
        </div>
        <p>
            In the image below the first line of text is what you will see at a screen width of 600px.
            The second line of text is what you will see at a screen width of 1200px.
        </p>
        <div class="code-box">
            <img class="code-image" src="../img/responsive-text-out.png" alt="text size comparisons">
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>If you want to experiment with these ideas on your own, make sure you have the following meta tag in
            the head section of your html page.
            &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            Hopefully you will now feel inspired to implement your own responsive web designs without
            relying on third party frameworks. In the era of Progressive Web Applications where performance
            is so vital; you would do well to streamline your apps by disposing of those monolithic frameworks
            that keep you trapped inside another persons head. Say goodbye to Bootstrap, Materialize, JQuery , React,
            Angular and all the other bloatware. Say hello to becoming your own designer using CSS.
