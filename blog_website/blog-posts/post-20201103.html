        If you are like me, you would have come across frameworks like Bootstrap while trying to figure out the nuances
        of responsive design. You probably sat down over a weekend and began playing around with container, row and column classes
        unable to <b>contain</b> your excitement as columns began automatically appearing and disappearing as you resized your screen.
        With the advent of HTML 5 and the CSS Grid component this has now become childs play.
    </p>
     <section>
        <h2>CSS Grid Demo</h2>
        <p>
            With just a few lines of code you can set up a grid that is not only responsive but fluid. In other words it will
            dynamically resize itself as you resize your screen. The following sets up an 12 x 12 grid where the columns are sized
            as fractional units of equal size. A fractional unit represents the actual available space, after subtracting out the
            space used up by fixed size elements, margins and padding.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        .demo-grid {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
            grid-template-rows: repeat(12, 30px);
            grid-gap: 10px;
            border: 2px solid black;
        }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            We can then reference any area of the grid with simple column and row number references like this.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        /* a box bounded by columns 4 through 9 and rows 4 through 9 (center of grid) */
        .demo-box {
            grid-column: 4 / span 6;
            grid-row: 4 / span 6;
            background: red;
        }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            Now we will create the html code to draw a a box centered inside the grid. Resize you browser window
            and notice how the box inside the grid shrinks and grows while maintaining its position relative to the grid.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        &lt;div class="demo-grid"&gt;
            &lt;div class="demo-box">&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <div class='demo-grid'>
            <div class="demo-box">
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Responsive Text Demo</h2>
        <p>
        Another item that is getting a fair amout of press these days is fluid typography which is just a fancy way
        of saying "responsive text". I will now demonstrate just how trivial this amazing feat is.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        .text-responsive {
            font-size: calc(1em + 1vw);
        }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            That's it. Its literally a 1 liner! Lets take a look and some html to see the effect.
            Resize your screen once again and notice how the text shrinks and grows based on the width of
            your browser window.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        &lt;div class="text-responsive"&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Header 1&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Header 2&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Header 3&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Header 4&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;h5&gt;Header 5&lt;/h5&gt;
            &lt;h6&gt;Header 6&lt;/h6&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is a Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
       </code></pre>
       <div class="text-responsive">
           <h1>Header 1</h1>
           <h2>Header 2</h2>
           <h3>Header 3</h3>
           <h4>Header 4</h4>
           <h5>Header 5</h5>
           <h6>Header 6</h6>
           <p>This is a paragraph</p>
       </div>
    </section>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>If you want to experiment with these ideas on your own, make sure you have the following meta tag in
            the head section of your html page.
            <br>
            &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            Hopefully you will now feel inspired to implement your own responsive web designs without
            relying on third party frameworks. In the era of Progressive Web Applications where performance
            is so vital; you would do well to streamline your apps by disposing of those monolithic frameworks
            that keep you trapped inside another persons head. Say goodbye to Bootstrap, Materialize, JQuery , React,
            Angular and all the other bloatware. Say hello to becoming your own designer using CSS.
